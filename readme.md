Made with Django Framework in backend and JavaScript in frontend
## Distinctivness and Complexity
My project is different from the things performed during the course, it has some similarities with some but it is a combination of them all, as well as with some other things learned by my self and added, some examples could be the the use of Image files , I have benefited from previous projects such as Commerce in the idea of blogs and from the linking of pages to each other from the wiki project , For the Complexity Requirement I can explain some things I had to learn by my self like some of functions for javescript and making the style of the website simple and full of colors , for the post requests I used django forms, javascript was used to put everything together and display it (frontend) and for the backend pyhton Django was used, i create 2 models one is for the blog posts (It contains a picture, title and date of creation of the blog, in addition to a detailed explanation). I use bootstrap to make the website looks professional 
i put social media links so people can visit them
